# Building a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow to Classify Handwritten Characters

A proof-of-concept project for converting scanned historical documents into searchable databases using CNNs.

## Scenario

A company providing ancestry search services needs to process handwritten documents. This project demonstrates how a CNN can identify scanned characters in the MNIST database with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
